        <p>For Pat Florio, a 71-year-old lifelong Woodside resident and Vice President of the Wynwoode Gardens Homeowners Association, figuring out the source of her neighborhood's flooding woes has been a decades-long mission. 

          Woodside gained national attention in September due to the deadly flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida, the neighborhood has dealt with deluges of water for as long as Florio can remember. 
          
         <p> “You learn to figure out a way to protect your house,” said Florio, who lives in a home her grandmother bought in the 1930s. </p>
          
         <p> Ida brought record rainfall to the New York City area and killed 13 people in the city. A two-year-old boy and his parents died in a basement apartment near the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. Their home was near a pumping station on the BQE that residents believe control the amount of water their streets contend with when it rains. </p>

        <p>There is no doubt that climate change has made–and will continue to make–flooding in New York City worse. But Woodside has dealt with floods for decades. In a 1982 letter to city officials, then-president of the Wynwoode Gardens Homeowners Association Lucy Ferguson wrote, “at this point any rainfall will cause flooding. This situation has been devastating throughout our area, causing loss of lives, collapsed foundations and untold dollars in property damage.” </p>
        
        <p>Pablo Herreros Cantis is a research fellow at the New School’s Urban Systems lab who studies urban resilience to climate change. 
          
          <p>“The places that flooded during Ida, before New York City even existed, were already natural courses of water,” he said. “​​We are reaching points in which
          it might be just not quite economically or technically viable to keep thinking about building a larger seawall or a larger levy. And that's where the whole conversation about managed retreat comes in,” he said, referring to programs that offer to buy out homeowners who live in flood-prone areas. </p>
          
         <p> Both the state and the city launched a buyout program after Superstorm Sandy. <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2021/10/26/22747880/nyc-buy-out-flood-prone-homes-climate-change-sandy-ida">The City</a> reported in October that the mayor’s office is looking at expanding the city’s program after Ida. </p>
          
          <p> A buyout isn’t an option for Florio’s home. “My grandmother bought it in 1934, and the house will go down with me,” she said. “When I go under, that's when the house will get sold.”  </p>
